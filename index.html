      <!-- About me and why -->
      <h3 style="text-align: center">About Stephen</h3>
      <p>
        Having been using my computer for most of my life, I have a strong
        desire to turn that into a real life to a career and I have been
        thoroughly enjoying coding. I am looking forward to working with people,
        above and below my skill level, to make it happen and am very excited
        for when it does.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Outside of the career life I love to play games of all types and workout.
        Another one of my passions is animals, I plan on having a farm with all
        types of animals later in life.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Hopefully starting at Thinkful has been the right choice to access this
        dream, and so far it is going well.
      </p>
